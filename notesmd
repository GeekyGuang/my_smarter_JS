- Reading a little and practicing a lot is the fastest way to learn.
- writing down all you can remember from a studied prose passage—can deepen the memory of that passage better than further study.

```javascript
var thanx = "Thanks for inputing";
alert(thanx);

alert(133); // alert会把括号内的值转换为字符串
```
