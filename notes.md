- Reading a little and practicing a lot is the fastest way to learn.
- writing down all you can remember from a studied prose passage—can deepen the memory of that passage better than further study.

```javascript
var thanx = "Thanks for inputing";
alert(thanx);

alert(133); // alert会把括号内的值转换为字符串
```

- Variable names are case sensitive, use camelCase, (a 1 _ $)

- % is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by
another. It gives you the remainder when the division is executed.

- ++/--
```javascript
var num = 1;
var newNum = num++; // newNum = 1, num = 2

var newNum = ++num; // newNum = 2, num = 2
```

- concatenate
```javascript
var name = "michael" + "Jacson" + 111  // 数字会自动转换为string

alert("2" + 2)  // 22
```
